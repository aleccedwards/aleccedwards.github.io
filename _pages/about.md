I'm a PhD student at the University of Oxford, with the CDT in Autonomous
Intelligent Machines and Systems [(AIMS)](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/). I'm
supervised by Alessandro Abate as part of [OxCAV](https://oxcav.web.ox.ac.uk/) in the Department of Computer Science.

My research interested lie at the intersection of artifical intelligence and
formal verification. In particular, I'm interested in how these two fields can
combine to help us create safer and more trustworthy models.
