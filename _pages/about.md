I'm a Research Scientist at [Phaidra](https://www.phaidra.ai/), where I work building physics-informed data-driven models of mission-critical industrial systems to enable their control through reinforcement learning. Previously I was a Research Associate in AI and Verification at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, working with [Alessandro Abate](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/alessandro.abate/) in the [OxCAV](https://oxcav.web.ox.ac.uk/) group. I completed a PhD within the CDT in Autonomous
Intelligent Machines and Systems [(AIMS)](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/),
supervised by Alessandro Abate in the Department of Computer Science.

My research interests lie broadly across artificial intelligence and formal verification.
In particular, I'm interested in the intersection of these two fields, and how they can be combined to help us build safer and more trustworthy models in real-world applications.
